# ðŸš€  peercat-tracker

This is the peer.cat BitTorrent tracker which the peer.cat frontend uses to share files between computers.
This repository is a copy of [webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) to
keep all files within the peer.cat domain.

It will be extended as soon as I need to.
